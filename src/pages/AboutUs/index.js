                  Refugee Action for Change (ReAct) is a refugee-led advocacy
                  group in Malaysia. Established in June 2019, to unify refugee
                  leaders and representatives from different nationalities and
                  ethnicities to advocate for the recognition of refugee rights
                  in Malaysia as a refugee-led effort. ReAct also works to
                  empower the community as advocates by providing relevant
                  capacity building training and awareness activities.

                    In 2019, ReAct emerged from a partnership between Tenaganita
                    and Beyond Borders following a consultation event involving
                    refugee leaders, NGO representatives, and government
                    officials from Health and Human Resource Ministries. Despite
                    organising into nine working groups to pursue advocacy
                    objectives, the initiative faced setbacks including
                    undefined member responsibilities, limited commitments,
                    insufficient funds, and poor coordination. However, in 2021
                    and March 2022, three coordinators underwent
                    capacity-building training to improve effectiveness. With
                    renewed funding in 2023, ReAct relaunched under new
                    leadership.

                  ReAct, a refugee-led advocacy group in Malaysia, has been
                  dedicated to unifying and empowering refugee leaders and

                  employment, ReAct has strategically worked towards improving
                  the lives of refugees in Malaysia. Despite challenges faced in
                  the past, ReAct has taken steps to strengthen their
                  organization through capacity building and leadership
                  training, demonstrating their commitment to creating lasting
